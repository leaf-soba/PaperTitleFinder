# PaperTitleFinder
- A simple solution to get the academic paper title.
- Most academic paper titles are in the largest font size on the first or second page.
- The shortest title in the world is 4 characters, so we didn't count any string less than 4 characters as title.
- All characters of the title should be in close proximity to each other, so we do not consider strings that are too far apart as part of the title.
